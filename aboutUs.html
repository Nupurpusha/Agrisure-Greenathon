        <div class="feature-item">
          <h3>1. Mixed Layer Farming</h3>
          <p>
            Transform your farming approach with Mixed Layer Farming—a method
            that optimizes land use by cultivating multiple crops in layers. By
            integrating this technique, FarmersHub helps you maximize
            productivity from limited space. Grow complementary crops together
            to enhance soil health, reduce erosion, and increase overall yield
            per acre. This approach not only boosts profitability but also
            promotes sustainable farming practices that benefit both the
            environment and your farm's long-term viability.

            weather information for the next three days, including temperature
            fluctuations, rainfall predictions, and wind patterns. This data

          <p>
            Gain access to customized recommendations for crop combinations
            tailored to your farm's specific conditions. Whether you're dealing

            availability, FarmersHub provides scientifically-backed suggestions
            to maximize crop compatibility and yield potential. This feature
            helps you diversify your crop portfolio strategically, reducing
